# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Mike Zaleski

## Round 1

### Day 12: June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Code Academy JS: Objects

**Thoughts:** Some really interesting stuff that I haven't seen taught so clearly before. I'm glad, after the Credit Card Checker activity, to explore more about mutation (both objects and arrays).

**Session Length:** 90 minutes

### Day 11: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Code Academy JS: Credit Card Checker Practice

**Thoughts:** Finished the Credit Card Checker practice activity. I got hung up on how to complete some of the finer points, like not adding duplicate credit card companies to an array when an invalid card is found. Highlighted some things I need to review (bang operator) and functions passing in arrays, because I wasn't always understanding why something was or wasn't working.

**Session Length:** 65 minutes

### Day 10: June 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Code Academy JS: Credit Card Checker Practice

**Thoughts:** Still working on this Credit Card checker. I was not totally focused today, but I'm doing a lot of trial and error with array methods and iterators. Lots of code checking at every point, but I have it mostly finished!

**Session Length:** 45 minutes

### Day 9: June 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Code Academy JS: Credit Card Checker Practice

**Thoughts:** I started Code Academy's [Credit Card Checker](https://www.codecademy.com/practice/projects/credit-card-checker) practice activity today. I'm moving at a slow pace, but I'm enjoying putting everything together. This is not a 40 minute practice for me right now, but I could fly through some of the components (like building the `validateCred()` function) faster than I expected.

**Session Length:** 65 minutes

### Day 8: June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Code Academy JS: continuing iterators

**Thoughts:** I spent most of my time this morning working on the iterator challenge: creating a linter to count words and match certain conditions for a string of text. I over complicated one section (matching over complicated words, actually) and now I want to get my version to work. I’m stuck midway so I’ll walk away and think about it for a while. This is so much fun, though, and I feel like I’m actually making progress!

**Session Length:** 75 minutes

### Day 7: June 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Code Academy JS: continuing iterators

**Thoughts:**

### Day 6: June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: CodeAcademy JS: Loops and Higher Order Functions

**Thoughts:** I’m about 50% through the CodeAcademy JS class and I just hit some mental resistance where I didn’t breeze through the material. Some of the advanced looping and now into Higher Order Functions are new to me, at least from the point of actually working through the steps with minimal guidance. It feels good!

**Session Length:** 90 minutes

### Day 5:June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: CodeAcademy JS: Iterators

**Thoughts:** The iterator concepts are getting a little tough, which is good. i like the way CodeAcademy builds on the info. Plus my notes have been an invaluable resource as I progress.

**Session Length:** 80 minutes

### Day 4: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: CodeAcademy JS: Scope and Arrays

**Thoughts:** These concepts are coalescing a bit more firmly, plus my notes are a great reference when I get stuck. It’s really helping with idea generation too. Almost time for a new notebook!

I also built an iOS shortcut to make these log entries and generate the tweet and archive them to my Day One journal as well. That was fun and a different kind of programming!

**Session Length:** 96 minutes

### Day 3: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued JS refresher on CodeAcademy

**Thoughts:** I finally understand the difference between function types in JS. I'm really digging CodeAcademy's interface, especially after working with video classes for so long. You have to do _exactly what they expect_ to move on to each step, but at least there is actual code evaluation going on. They also don't give you all the answers, which is really good. I'm about 20% of the way through the JS course and have been thankful for this refresher and clarification. Throughout the day, I'm working out some ideas in my head for the projects I want to build. It's fun to practice, then to plan.

**Session Length:** 85 minutes

### Day 2: May 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher on CodeAcademy

**Thoughts:** I spent this morning going through the first 20% or so of the JavaScript course on CodeAcademy. I'm mostly interested in highlighting what I don't know, and helping to bring old knowledge back up to the surface. I'm not going to dwell too much on this course (I'm hopefully going to put in some additional time on my app today too) but I think it's a good return to basics.

**Session Length:** 87 minutes

### Day 1: May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Family Video website in React

**Thoughts:** It's tough to hit the ground running but I feel empowered to break out of "tutorial hell". I initialized my `create-react-app` project, got `react-router` working, some `react-bootstrap` elements, and the `react-player` to display the videos. For now, I'm storing the video data in a JSON object that gets pulled into state.

After my initial HomePage component, I'm currently working on a LatestVideos component that will show the 2-4 most recently added videos. I ran into a snag passing props down through `react-router` so I'm going to do more reading up on best practices to prep for tomorrow's session.

### Day 0: May 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Setup DOC on Github, Started React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial

**Thoughts:** After working through multiple, complex React courses, I need to slow down and start back at basics. It was tough to do with the React tutorial, even though there was 40% that I felt I was seeing for the first time.
