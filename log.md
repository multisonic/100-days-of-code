# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Mike Zaleski
## Round 1

### Day 0: May 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Setup DOC on Github, Started React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial

**Thoughts:** After working through multiple, complex React courses, I need to slow down and start back at basics. It was tough to do with the React tutorial, even though there was 40% that I felt I was seeing for the first time.
