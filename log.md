# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Mike Zaleski
## Round 1

### Day 1: May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Family Video website in React

**Thoughts:** It's tough to hit the ground running but I feel empowered to break out of "tutorial hell". I initialized my `create-react-app` project, got `react-router` working, some `react-bootstrap` elements, and the `react-player` to display the videos.  For now, I'm storing the video data in a JSON object that gets pulled into state.

After my initial HomePage component, I'm currently working on a LatestVideos component that will show the 2-4 most recently added videos. I ran into a snag passing props down through `react-router` so I'm going to do more reading up on best practices to prep for tomorrow's session.

### Day 0: May 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Setup DOC on Github, Started React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial

**Thoughts:** After working through multiple, complex React courses, I need to slow down and start back at basics. It was tough to do with the React tutorial, even though there was 40% that I felt I was seeing for the first time.
